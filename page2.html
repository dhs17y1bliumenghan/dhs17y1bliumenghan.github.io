<h2> Introduction to French </h2>
<p>French is a Romance language of the Indo-European family that descended from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French has evolved from Gallo-Romance, the spoken Latin in Gaul, and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in southern Belgium, which French has largely supplanted. French is an official language in 29 countries. It is spoken as a first language in France, the Canadian provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, the region of Wallonia in Belgium, western Switzerland, Monaco, certain other regions of Canada and the United States, and by various cities and countries. French is also the fourth-most widely spoken mother tongue in the European Union. 1/5 of Europeans who do not have French as a mother tongue speak French as a second language. French has a long history as an international language of literature, and scientific some standards and is a second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, the WTO, the International Olympic Committee, and the ICRC. In 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek ranked French the third most useful language for business, after English and Standard Mandarin Chinese.[13]</p>
<h2>French VS English</h2>
 <h3>Vocabulary</h3> <p>A large number of words in the two languages have the same Latin roots and are mutually comprehensible, although this applies more to technical words than to everyday vocabulary. The concomitant problem, however, is the significant number of false friends (Eg:) The French word is listed first, followed by the correct English equivalent</p>
 <h3>Grammar: Tenses</h3>
 <p>Both languages have auxiliaries, participles, active/passive voice, past/present/future tenses. However, there are some differences that can cause interference in the production of English. A typical problem is the wrong choice of tense. Despite the external similarities of verb grammar, there are frequent occasions when French uses a different tense to convey a particular meaning than English.</p>
