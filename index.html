        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Liu Menghan, a 13-year-old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, Singapore.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I love reading fiction books, and sometimes watching anime. I also like some sports like cycling and roller blading. Painting or sketching is also one of my hobbies.</p>
        <h2>Subjects</h2>
        <p>Other than the usual 6 subjects: Language Arts, Chinese, Mathematics, Science, Geography and History, I also took up a 3rd language French! Although it is time consuming, but it is defintely worth the time as learning another language might come in handy in the future.</p>
        <h2>Learning Journeys</h2>
        <p>We went to 3 learning journeys in Term 2 Week 9: <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/">Natural History Museum</a> for Science; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Singapore">Chinatown</a> for History; <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/macritchie-reservoir-park">MacRitchie Reservoir</a> for Geography. It was a fruitful expereince and I learnt a lot from the trips.</p>
