        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Liu Menghan, a 13-year-old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I love reading fiction books that are action-packed or conspiracy novels that give a air of mystery when reading it. I also like some sports like cycling and rollerblading. Painting and sketching are also my hobbies.</p>
        <h2>Subjects</h2>
        <p>Other than the usual 6 subjects: Language Arts, Chinese, Mathematics, Science, Geography and History, I also took up a 3rd language French! Although it is time consuming, but it is definitely worth the time as learning another language might come in handy in the future.</p>
        <h2>Learning Journeys</h2>
        <p>We went to 3 learning journeys in Term 2 Week 9: <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/">Natural History Museum</a> for Science; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Singapore">Chinatown</a> for History; <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/macritchie-reservoir-park">MacRitchie Reservoir</a> for Geography. It was a fruitful experience and I learnt a lot from the trips.</p>
        
      <h3>Science:</h3> <p>We went to <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/">Natural History Museum</a> and learned classification of living organisms to start off with Biology in Term 3. Furthermore, we had the opportunity to try and identify the organism samples by using the classification methods we had learnt earlier on.</p>
      <h3>History:</h3> <p>We went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Singapore">Chinatown</a> and studied the life of the early Chinese migrants that came to Singapore. We had to write an Autobiography in the perspective of an Chinese migrant. However, some of the other groups went to <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/kampong-glam.html">Kampong Glam</a> and some went to <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/places-to-see/little-india.html">Little India</a>.
      <h3>Geography:</h3> <p>We went to <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/macritchie-reservoir-park">MacRitchie Reservoir</a> and collected some water samples for testing. We tested the turbidity, amount of dissolved oxygen, pH and analysed the data to conclude the overall water quality.</p>
